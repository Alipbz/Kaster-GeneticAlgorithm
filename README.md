# Kaster-GeneticAlgorithm
Kasterisk's repository for experimenting with (what hopefully would become) a semi-realistic yet simple model of genetic algorithm simulation/neural network based "game"/software(?) as represented by (currently) living tiny microorganisms in a dynamic environment.

No GA yet, as works are still being done for the frameworks itself.
